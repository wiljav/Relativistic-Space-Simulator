# Relativistic Space Simulator: The Capped Eye Theory

This project was developed using **vibe coding**—a high-level, iterative, and intuitive approach to software engineering where the focus is on the rapid realization of complex systems through "vibe-aligned" development.

# The Capped Eye Theory: A Mechanical Approach to Quantum Gravity

## Overview
The **Capped Eye Theory** is a computational model that resolves the "Singularity Problem" in General Relativity by introducing a **Hardware Resolution Floor**. By treating the universe as an observer-dependent digital system with a fixed minimum pixel size (Planck Length $l_P$), we prevent the mathematical "explosions" (infinities) typically found at the centers of black holes or the start of the Big Bang.

## Core Problem
In standard physics, General Relativity allows space to shrink infinitely. When distance $r$ approaches $0$, the gravitational force $F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$ approaches infinity. This "Divide by Zero" error suggests our current models are incomplete.

## The Solution: The "Hardware Floor"
This model applies an **Engineering Tolerance** to spacetime. We assume the "Observer's Eye" has a minimum resolution. 
- **Lorentz Contraction Cap:** As velocity $v$ approaches $c$, length contraction occurs, but it is hard-capped at the Planck Length ($1.616 \times 10^{-35}m$). 
- **Singularity Prevention:** Gravitational force is recalculated using a "Safe Distance" buffer: 
  $$F = \frac{G m_1 m_2}{\max(r, l_P)^2}$$

## Key Simulations & Results
Our Three.js-based simulation environment has confirmed the following:

1. **The Gravity Plateau:** Instead of a vertical spike to infinity, the gravitational potential flattens into a stable plateau at the Planck scale.
2. **Resolution Saturation:** At $99.9\%$ light speed, the visual field undergoes "Quantum Graininess" (pixelation). This represents the observer's hardware hitting the universal bit-depth limit.
3. **Temporal Drift:** Confirmed that while time dilation remains consistent with Einstein's equations, the "Capped" observer experiences a discrete frame-rate at the limit.

## Mechanical Engineering Analogy
Just as a digital sensor cannot capture details smaller than its pixel size, the Universe cannot process interactions smaller than the Planck Length. In this model, the "Singularity" is simply the point where the hardware runs out of resolution.

## How to Run the Sim
1. The application runs in a web browser.
2. Ensure you have a compatible environment to execute ES6 modules and React.
3. Adjust the **Velocity Slider** to observe the **Resolution Sinking** and the **Gravity Plateau** in real-time via the Science Debugger panel.
